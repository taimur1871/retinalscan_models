# Retinal Scan Models

Retinal scans are useful tools for detecting a number of eye conditions. However, it requires an expert to read and decipher these images. The goal of this project is to develop models for detecting various types of disease. In the first iteration the model created will try to distinguish between,

* Diabetic Retinopathy
* Glaucoma
* Normal scans
* Other ailments

This dataset was taken from a Kaggle competition. The details can be found here (https://www.kaggle.com/c/vietai-advance-course-retinal-disease-detection/overview)

### What is Diabetic Retinopathy?

The image below shows a high contrast example of Diabetic Retinopathy

### What is Glaucoma?

The image below shows an example of Glaucoma. The area affected by Glaucoma is around the optic disk.
