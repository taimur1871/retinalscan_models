# Retinal Scan Models

Retinal scans are useful tools for detecting a number of eye conditions. However, it requires an expert to read and decipher these images. The goal of this project is to develop models for detecting various types of disease. In the first iteration the model created will try to distinguish between,

* Diabetic Retinopathy
* Glaucoma
* Normal scans
* Other ailments

### What is Diabetic Retinopathy

The image below shows an example of Diabetic Retinopathy.It is normally seen as
